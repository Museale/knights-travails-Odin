Assignment:

1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
    - Knight has the ability to do 8 possible moves from any square.
2. Treat all the possible moves a knight could make as children in a tree. Don't allow any moves to go off the board.
3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use in this scenario. Hint: One of them could be a potentially infinite series.
4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square and the goal. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.: 
[3,3]
[4,5]
[2,4]
[4,3]
